# Features

- Sending messages to another user

# Extra credit

- Allow sending images in chat
- Add a friends list that users can add other users to and see when someone is online
  (alternative: “Add a users list to show which users are currently online”)
- Allow users to create and send messages in group chats

# Limitations

- You may have realized that a REST API backend cannot handle real time updates. It is “request-response”, so the server can only respond to a request. If a user sends a message to another user, a REST API cannot automatically notify the recipient as the recipient will not have requested that data.

# To-do

- On friend accept, automatically create a chat with them

- Change AddFriend component to AddChat and fix all of that

- Default avatars for groups
- Make img alt text for friends and groups profile picture
