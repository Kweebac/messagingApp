# Features

- Sending messages to another user
- Customizing a user profile
  - Username
  - Avatar
  - About me

# Extra credit

- Allow sending images in chat
- Add a friends list that users can add other users to and see when someone is online
  (alternative: “Add a users list to show which users are currently online”)
- Allow users to create and send messages in group chats

# Limitations

- You may have realized that a REST API backend cannot handle real time updates. It is “request-response”, so the server can only respond to a request. If a user sends a message to another user, a REST API cannot automatically notify the recipient as the recipient will not have requested that data.

# To-do

- Implement default avatars for users and groups
- Validate avatar file upload server-side with express-validator
- Figure out saving avatars to database and importing them, and use default avatars when creating a User or Chat
- Name saved images by username
- Make img alt text <username>'s profile picture
